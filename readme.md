# Project Euler answers

This repository is meant to be a record of **my** answers to the problems on [Project Euler][https://projecteuler.net/], written in F# for the sake of honing my logic skills.

It is published publicly on GitHub for the sake of demonstrating these skills to employers. 

However, as it goes against the spirit of Project Euler to share and publish answers past the 100 first problems, this repository will not contain solutions to problems past the first 100 and it is advised that you attempt to solve problems yourself before viewing the code here.
